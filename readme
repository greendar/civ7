### Project codename: CIV VII Bible

Currently, we are working on creating people’s stats and automatically increasing their age.

Semi-permanent stats:
Speed
Stamina
Strength
Industriousness (changed to ingenuity)
intelligence
Curiosity
Awareness
Aggression
Attractiveness(?)
Necessary Consumption

Impermanent stats:
Age

Semi-permanent stats are mostly rigid, but can change based on certain events/actions(?).
Impermanent stats constantly change. eg: age increases each cycle

Currently, we are experimenting with stats affecting other stats. ie: A higher speed stat means that it’s more likely for a Sim to have higher stamina.

Max is working on reproduction.

Suggested naming systems:
Adding the numbers of the parents?
???

Height and weight system implemented. More height means higher speed and higher awareness. Higher weight (muscle mass) increases strength, but decreases speed(?).
